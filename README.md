# CSE450 Translation of Programming Languages at MSU
This repository contains completed course material for a class teaching the basics of compilers
and includes an implmentaion of a simple declarative programing language sparty talk. It was
implemented via Python's RPLY module that was inspired by the lex and Yacc compiler tools.
The language supports variables, arithmetic and boolean operations along with simple flow control 
(While loop, if, else) and functions (different scopes)
